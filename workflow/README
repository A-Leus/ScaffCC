Before running script you need to create workflow/env.py file to set environment variables manually.
Create a variable 'scaff_dir' and set it to the root directory of ScaffCC on your system.
Don't commit this file just keep it locally.

From any directory run 'python workworkwork.py'. Tested with python 2.7

Make sure to change the scaff_dir at the top of the file to one locally.

The script will run a bunch of benchmarks and insert the custom pass at the end of the normal scaffold flow.
