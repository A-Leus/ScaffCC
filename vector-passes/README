1) Build there version of llvm (3.1 w/ their quantum passes + others)
  Okay that fails after successfully building on ubuntu16.04 wsl
2) Hack cmake file to get the right directories to compile own pass outside of llvm tree
3) If you want .ll either scaffold.h -qk <.scaffold> or scripts/gen-ll.sh <.scaffold>
  For scaffold cmd, use <file>1.ll and after, but not <file>.ll
4) ./build/Release+Asserts/bin/opt -S -load vector-passes/build/src/libTestPass.so -test cat_state.n04/cat_state.n04.ll
